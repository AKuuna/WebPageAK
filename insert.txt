About Me 

Hi I'm AKuuna. It's awsome that you've found this page. That surely means you want to get to know me, right? 
To be frank I have no clue if making this page was ever a good idea. However I do find all css stuff intriguing and this page is a result of my playground with it. 

Here are some projects I'm proud of

I hopelessly enjoy learning some new skills and much part of my free time consist of joyful coding and finding new ideas for projects. 

Here will be some teasers of things I'd like to share :)


My hobbies
Yes, I've got ones!
I'm suprisingly good at killing plants. But never they are alone in the process! I collect more and more green stuff so they have each other during difficult time.

I've got good connection with memes. I believe this friendship is love and it's two sided. 
That's why below, in the relatively near future, you'll find daily meme. But let's not make you too spolied right now.

In my free time I enjoy reading fantasy books, dancing and playing computer games. I esspecially like metrodivania and pixel game themes. Maybe one day I'll take some part in creating such a gaming project :)


You've made it here. Wow, I'm proud. Here is a reward, daily quote taken freshly from japanese sage.
